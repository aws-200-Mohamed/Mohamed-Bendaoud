## 🧭 Professional Profile

I am a **Cloud Security Architect** specializing in protecting large-scale, mission-critical cloud environments across **AWS, Azure, and GCP**.

My focus is simple and uncompromising:  
**build cloud systems that are secure by design, resilient by default, and trusted at scale.**

I work where architecture, security engineering, and risk management meet — translating complex threats into controlled, measurable security outcomes.

## 🧠 Security Philosophy

> **Security is not a product you buy.  
> It is an architecture you design and a discipline you maintain.**

Scalability and security are not opposites —  
when done right, they reinforce each other.
